  errors occur.  
- Make the changes and deploy to the test environment.  
	- If need be rollback changes using github to a previously working verison
	- Ideally create automated tests but do manually testing if necessary
	- Use an issue tracking tool like Jira or Github Issues to track any issues or bugs found.
	- Make sure the testing has appropriate load of usage on the applicaiton which can be automated 
- Once ready, deploy to production and continue to montor with the dashboard monitor.
